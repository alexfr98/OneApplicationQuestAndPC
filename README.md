Basic Project - 2:

Unity project to have, in the same Unity application and in the same Unity Scene, the XR Headset and the PC. The XR Headset has to be connected to the PC using Oculus Link.

XR Interaction toolkit and XR Plugin management packages were used for setting up this project. The VRScene is a copy of the Demo Scene from the XR interaction Toolkit samples.

In the first scene, you can click the button to go to the VRScene. Also, if while being in the PC Scene you use the XR Headset, the camera will change and the text "Come back to the PC" will appear on the Headset screen and the PC screen.

--> THIS WAS TESTED ON THE OCULUS QUEST 2 AND THE META QUEST PRO.
