Basic Project - 2:

Unity project to have the same application and in the same Scene, the Oculus Quest and the PC. The Oculus Quest has to be connected to the PC using Oculus Link.

XR Interaction toolkit and XR Plugin management packages were used for setting up this project. The VRScene is a copy of the Demo Scene from the XR interaction Toolkit samples.

In the first scene, you can click the button to go to the VRScene. Also, if while being in the PC Scene you use the VR Headset, the camera will change and the text "Come back to the PC" will appear in the Quest and in the PC.
